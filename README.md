## ‚öîÔ∏è Welcome to *Axe-Throw Simulator: Kratos Edition (kinda)*

This little project was born purely out of hype after a GOW gaming binge.  
I saw the axe return. I felt the *thump*. I booted up Unity.

*This isn‚Äôt a full game.* It‚Äôs me geeking out over how ridiculously cool it feels to toss an axe and have it *swirl* back into your hand like it missed you.

## üéÆ What This Is

A Unity sandbox recreating the core *Leviathan Axe* mechanic ‚Äî throw, fly, return, repeat.  
If you‚Äôve ever wanted to yeet an axe and call it back like a god, well‚Ä¶ here you go.
